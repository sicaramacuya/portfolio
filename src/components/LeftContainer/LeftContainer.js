I most likely will be specialized on data science, and iOS mobile development by fall of 2022. I can't say I'm a full fletch Software Engineer yet. Nevertheless, that won't stop me from letting you know about my skills. That's why I will be sharing my biggest projects at the moment and some of my skills that can be put to use here."
